# LeafSim

This repo is part of a research project I worked on at Texas A&M.

The idea is to simulate electron beam therapy.

Specifically, we have a 10 MeV electron beam hitting two types of targets, a CsI (Cesium Iodide) and water target. Theses targets are seperated into voxels and act as detectors to record energy desposition. Part of the electron beam is blocked by tungsten plates called Leaves.

The goal is to measure dosage in these voxels based off of the position of these tungsten plates.
